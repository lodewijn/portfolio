## My favourite equation

My favourite equations are: $x(t)=16sin^3(t),$ and $y(t)=13cos(t)−5cos(2t)−2cos(3t)−cos(4t),$ with $t∈[0,2π],$ because I \<3 equations.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

t <- seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 1000)

x <- 16 * sin(t)^3
y <- 13*cos(t) - 5*cos(2*t) - 2*cos(3*t) - cos(4*t)

df <- data.frame(x, y)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_path(color = "red", size = 1) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_void()
```

## Fun fact

When I was a baby, I was really fat. ![](babyloes.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}
